# Descending into Machine Learning

When predicting continuous data, we may try and draw a line of best fit through our data points in order to perform inference.
This process is known as *linear regression*

How do we determine what is the line of best fit? To do this we need to have some notion of error. This is provided through a *loss function*

One simple loss function is the *LeastMeanSquares* function. This is calculated as the average square of distance between a predicted value and the actual data value.
