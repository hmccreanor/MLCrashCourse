# Framing

Label: the value you want to predict (usually denoted by y)
Features: what you are using to inform your predictions (usually denoted by x_n)

You can train a model with examples. These can be either:
Labeled: label is provided along with the features
Unlabeled: only the features are provided

Models can be supervised or unsupervised.
Supervised: labeled data is used to train the model
Unsupervised: unlabeled data is used to train the model

Once a model has been trained you can perform inference.
Inference: predicting an unseen label given some feature values

Classification models are used to predict discrete data
Regression models are used to predict continuous data
